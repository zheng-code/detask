*detask* is a project built by Team ZhengCode (Fheng Guo Jing, Benjamin and Christian James Welly) for CP2106 (Orbital), a summer-long independent software engineering module. The project attained the highest level of achievement, [Apollo 11](https://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/?p=45), in the module. Our final submission report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E9MDTBPoPHKJOVJNi6SsLq-xQj1mefgllzGYb93G5FU/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=101062236602867497167).
